## **Day 3 Agenda: Database Concepts – Relational (MySQL) & NoSQL (MongoDB)**

**Theme**: Core Database Theory & Hands-on Data Modeling
**Total Duration**: 8 Hours
**Goal**: Develop a clear understanding of structured and unstructured data models, query languages (SQL & MongoQL), and when to use which type of database in real-world scenarios.

### **09:30 AM – 10:00 AM**

### Daily Stand-up + Recap from Day 2

* Summary of Java & Spring Boot learnings
* Set expectations for database day
* "What is data, and why does its structure matter?"

---

### **10:00 AM – 11:30 AM**

### **Module 1: Relational Databases (MySQL) – Foundations**

* What is a Relational Database?
* Data is stored in tables: rows, columns
* Primary Key, Foreign Key, Constraints
* Data Types: INT, VARCHAR, DATE, TEXT
* ER Modeling – Entities and Relationships
* ACID Properties and Transactions
* Normalization vs Denormalization

> **Notebook App Case Study**:
> Model `User`, `Notebook`, `Note` with relationships

---

### **Hands-on Activity**

* Install or connect to MySQL (local/cloud)
* Create schema for notebook app
* Create tables and apply constraints
* Insert, update, delete, and select records

---

### **11:30 AM – 11:45 AM**

**Break**

---

### **11:45 AM – 01:00 PM**

### **Module 2: SQL Query Language (MySQL)**

* CRUD Operations with SQL
* SELECT with WHERE, LIKE, IN
* ORDER BY, GROUP BY, Aggregate functions
* JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
* Subqueries and Views
* Indexing Basics

> **Notebook App Use Case**:
> Get all notes by user, notes created today, most recent notebooks, notebooks with most notes.

---

### **01:00 PM – 02:00 PM**

**Lunch Break**

---

### **02:00 PM – 03:30 PM**

### **Module 3: NoSQL & MongoDB – Foundations**

* What is NoSQL? Why MongoDB?
* Document-based storage
* Collections, Documents, Fields, BSON
* Dynamic schema vs strict schema
* CRUD Operations with Mongo shell
* Pros & Cons of schema flexibility

> **Notebook App Use Case**:
> Store a note with tags, images, comments as embedded documents.

---

### **Hands-on Activity**

* Install or connect to MongoDB
* Create collections and insert documents
* Perform queries using MongoDB shell / Compass
* Update and delete operations

---

### **03:30 PM – 03:45 PM**

**Break**

---

### **03:45 PM – 05:00 PM**

### **Module 4: SQL vs NoSQL – Comparative Study**

* Differences in structure, query language, scalability
* Use cases where one excels over the other
* When to go Hybrid (Polyglot Persistence)
* Trade-offs: Flexibility vs Reliability
* Evolution of Data Needs in Modern Applications

> **Mini Discussion**:
> Which database would you use for:
>
> * Notes with nested tags and attachments
> * App configuration settings
> * Authentication data
> * Audit trail logs

---

### **05:00 PM – 05:30 PM**

### **Retrospective + Quiz + Open Q\&A**

* What was learned today?
* Quiz: SQL vs NoSQL use case match-up
* Q\&A and doubts
* Align expectations for Day 4 (Spring Boot DB Integration)
