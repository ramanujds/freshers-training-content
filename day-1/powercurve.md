## **Module 4: Introduction to PowerCurve and Its Role in Real Projects**

---

### **1. What is PowerCurve?**

* **PowerCurve** is a suite of decision management tools developed by **Experian**.
* It helps businesses make real-time, automated, data-driven decisions—especially in financial and risk-based environments.

---

### **2. Key Components of PowerCurve**

| Component                               | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PowerCurve Strategy Management (SM)** | Define, test, and deploy decisioning logic visually.         |
| **PowerCurve Originations**             | Used in credit approval processes, onboarding workflows.     |
| **PowerCurve Customer Management**      | Manages customer strategies post-loan or credit issuance.    |
| **Decision Engine / Rules Engine**      | Executes rules and logic for real-time or batch decisioning. |

---

### **3. Architecture Overview**

* Typically acts as a **decision engine** within enterprise systems.
* Can be integrated with:

    * RESTful APIs
    * Spring Boot Microservices
    * External databases (Postgres, Oracle)
    * Frontend portals (Angular/React)

> In our **Notebook App Case Study**, imagine a future scenario where notes get classified by sensitivity using PowerCurve logic (based on rules like tags, keywords, etc.)

### **4. Agile Integration with PowerCurve Projects**

| Agile Phase     | PowerCurve Activity                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements    | Define decisioning rules, KPIs, strategy matrices              |
| Sprint Planning | Plan for rule creation, UAT environment setup                  |
| Implementation  | Use SM to configure strategies; expose APIs to fetch decisions |
| Testing         | Rule simulation, decision trace analysis, test data injections |
| Review/Retro    | Evaluate how effective rules are in business impact            |

---

### **5. Real-World Use Cases**

* **Credit Card Approval System**
  Evaluate eligibility in real-time using PowerCurve strategy engine

* **Loan Origination System**
  Route applications based on credit score, age, income, etc.

* **Fraud Detection**
  Automatically flag suspicious activities through rules

---

### **6. Developer Involvement**

* PowerCurve developers work on:

    * Rule configuration (GUI + DSL)
    * API integration for decision calls
    * Performance tuning of decision strategies
    * Collaboration with business analysts and QA

---

### **Mini Exercise:**

> *Design a basic rule set for approving a digital notebook feature like “Secure Notes.”*
> Rules could include:
>
> * If user is "premium" AND device is "trusted", allow secure notes
> * Else, show upgrade prompt

---

### **By the End of This Module, Learners Will Be Able To:**

* Understand what PowerCurve is and its enterprise role
* Map Agile SDLC phases with decision management tools
* Visualize how PowerCurve integrates with Java/Spring Boot apps
* Get a glimpse into rule-based system thinking
