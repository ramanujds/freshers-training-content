## What Are Database Services in GCP?

GCP provides **fully managed database services**, which means you don't have to worry about setup, infrastructure, backups, replication, or scaling — Google takes care of it.

There are two main categories:

1. **Relational Databases** (SQL-based)
2. **Non-Relational Databases** (NoSQL)

---

## 1. Relational Database Services (SQL)

These databases are good for applications that need **structured data**, **relationships**, and **ACID transactions** (e.g., banking, ERP, etc.).

| Service           | Description                                                    | Common Use Cases                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Cloud SQL**     | Managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server                      | Web apps, CMS, WordPress          |
| **Cloud Spanner** | Globally distributed, horizontally scalable SQL database       | Financial systems, SaaS platforms |
| **BigQuery**      | Serverless, fast, highly scalable data warehouse for analytics | Data analytics, ML, reporting     |

---

### **Cloud SQL**

Think of it as MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server in the cloud, with:

* Automatic backups
* High availability
* IAM security

**Use case**: A Spring Boot app using MySQL.

```bash
gcloud sql instances create my-sql-db \
  --database-version=MYSQL_8_0 \
  --tier=db-f1-micro \
  --region=us-central1
```

---

### **Cloud Spanner**

Unique to Google! Combines SQL schema and **horizontal scaling** like NoSQL.

* Strong consistency
* Global replication
* SQL syntax

**Use case**: Online banking system with global traffic.

---

### **BigQuery**

A powerful analytics engine — more of a **data warehouse** than a traditional DB.

* Use SQL-like queries
* Serverless (you don’t provision machines)
* Works great for TBs or PBs of data

**Use case**: Running sales and marketing reports from a large dataset.

## 2. Non-Relational Database Services (NoSQL)

Used when your data is **unstructured**, **semi-structured**, or doesn't require complex relationships.

| Service                | Type                                  | Common Use Cases                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Firestore**          | Document                              | Mobile/web apps, real-time updates |
| **Cloud Bigtable**     | Wide-column                           | IoT, time-series, logs             |
| **MemoryStore**        | In-memory (Redis/Memcached)           | Caching, session storage           |
| **Datastore (Legacy)** | Document (older version of Firestore) | Older apps using NoSQL             |

---

### **Firestore**

* NoSQL document DB (like MongoDB)
* Realtime syncing
* Strong integration with Firebase

**Use case**: Chat apps, real-time dashboards

---

### **Cloud Bigtable**

* High throughput
* Used internally by Google (e.g., Gmail, Maps)
* Scales to billions of rows

**Use case**: Storing sensor data from IoT devices

---

### **MemoryStore**

* Fully managed Redis or Memcached
* Superfast in-memory caching

**Use case**: Improve speed of a Spring Boot or Angular app by caching database queries.

## Summary Table

| Service       | Type       | Use Case                          |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Cloud SQL     | Relational | Web apps, CMS, transactional apps |
| Cloud Spanner | Relational | Global apps, financial systems    |
| BigQuery      | Analytics  | Reporting, data analysis          |
| Firestore     | NoSQL      | Real-time apps, mobile/web apps   |
| Bigtable      | NoSQL      | IoT, logs, time-series data       |
| MemoryStore   | Cache      | Fast caching, session storage     |

## Benefits of GCP Database Services

* Fully managed (no server management)
* Secure with IAM & VPC
* Auto-scaling & high availability
* Integrated with GCP tools (Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, etc.)
