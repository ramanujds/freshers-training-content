## What is MySQL on GCP?

MySQL is an **open-source relational database** used for web apps, SaaS platforms, and enterprise systems. On GCP, you can run MySQL in two main ways:

---

## 1. **Cloud SQL for MySQL** (Fully Managed – Recommended)

> **Managed by Google. You only manage the data, not the infrastructure.**

### Key Features:

| Feature                | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fully Managed**      | No need to manage VMs, OS, MySQL updates, backups, etc. |
| **Backups**            | Automatic + On-demand                                   |
| **High Availability**  | Multi-zone failover                                     |
| **IAM & Security**     | Uses IAM, VPC, Private IP                               |
| **Monitoring**         | Stackdriver (Cloud Monitoring) integration              |
| **Scalability**        | Easy vertical scaling (more RAM, CPU, disk)             |
| **Connection Options** | Private IP, Public IP, Auth Proxy, JDBC socket factory  |

### How it works (Behind the Scenes):

* Google **creates a managed VM**, installs MySQL
* Adds layers for monitoring, failover, IAM auth
* You **connect via IP or proxy**, and use it like any regular MySQL DB

### When to Use Cloud SQL for MySQL:

* Web or mobile app backends
* Spring Boot / Django / Node.js apps
* SaaS products needing transactional DB
* Reporting/BI dashboards (OLTP)

---

## 2. **MySQL on Compute Engine (Self-Managed)**

> **You install and manage MySQL on your own VM.**

### What You Do:

* Create VM → SSH in → Install MySQL manually
* Manage:

    * Updates
    * Security patches
    * Backups & restore
    * Monitoring & alerting
    * Failover & scaling

### Why You Might Use This:

* Need full OS-level control
* Complex configurations (plugins, specific MySQL builds)
* Want to experiment in a dev/test environment

## Comparing Cloud SQL vs Self-Managed

| Feature       | Cloud SQL                   | Self-Managed on GCE             |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Management    | Fully Managed by Google     | You manage everything           |
| Backups       | Built-in (auto + on-demand) | Manual scripting                |
| HA / Failover | Click-to-enable             | Set up load balancers, replicas |
| Security      | IAM, SSL, VPC               | Must configure manually         |
| Cost          | Higher (for convenience)    | Lower (but more effort)         |
| Scaling       | Easy (via UI/API)           | Manual                          |

## How to Set Up MySQL on GCP (Cloud SQL)

### Step 1: Create MySQL Instance

1. Go to **GCP Console → SQL → Create Instance**
2. Choose **MySQL**
3. Give instance name, set root password
4. Choose region/zone
5. Enable **private IP** (for secure VPC connection)
6. Set storage, backups, and HA if needed

### Step 2: Create Database & Users

* Once instance is up → Click instance → **“Databases” tab**
* Create your schema (e.g., `myappdb`)
* Add new users with restricted privileges

### Step 3: Connect from App or Client

Options:

* **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy** (secure, recommended)
* **Private IP** (internal traffic)
* **Public IP** (only when absolutely needed)
* **JDBC socket factory** (if using Java)

## Security Best Practices

| Practice                   | Reason                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Use private IP             | Avoid public exposure        |
| Use IAM for access control | Avoid hardcoded credentials  |
| Enable SSL connections     | Encrypt DB traffic           |
| Limit DB user privileges   | Principle of least privilege |
| Enable automated backups   | For recovery & rollback      |

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

Cloud SQL integrates with:

* **Cloud Monitoring** (disk, CPU, connections, queries)
* **Cloud Logging** (audit logs, slow queries, errors)
* **Alerts** for high CPU, slow queries, etc.

## Pricing Overview (Cloud SQL for MySQL)

| Component       | Charged For         |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Instance uptime | vCPU + RAM          |
| Storage         | GB used             |
| Backups         | GB of backup data   |
| Egress          | Network traffic out |
