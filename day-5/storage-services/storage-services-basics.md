## **Storage Services in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

GCP offers various types of storage services, each suited for different use cases like storing files, running databases, or sharing files between virtual machines.

Letâ€™s explore each type one by one:

---

### 1. **Cloud Storage** (Object Storage)

**What it is**:
A highly durable, scalable, and cost-effective service for storing unstructured data like files, images, videos, logs, backups, and so on.

**Key Features**:

* Stores data as objects in *buckets*
* Supports multiple *storage classes* for different access patterns:

    * Standard: Frequently accessed data
    * Nearline: Accessed about once a month
    * Coldline: Accessed a few times a year
    * Archive: Rarely accessed, long-term storage
* Global access via URL or API
* Versioning and lifecycle rules

**Use Cases**:

* Hosting static website content
* Backup and archival of logs or media
* Data lake for analytics

**Example Commands**:

```bash
gsutil mb gs://my-bucket/
gsutil cp file.txt gs://my-bucket/
```

### 2. **Persistent Disks** (Block Storage)

**What it is**:
Block-level storage used by Compute Engine virtual machines. Acts like a physical hard drive.

**Types**:

* Standard persistent disk (HDD)
* SSD persistent disk
* Balanced persistent disk

**Key Features**:

* Can be attached to one or more VMs
* Data persists even after VM shutdown
* Snapshots supported for backups

**Use Cases**:

* Operating system disk for VMs
* Hosting databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Storing application data

---

### 3. **Filestore** (File Storage)

**What it is**:
A fully managed Network File System (NFS) for shared file storage between multiple VMs.

**Key Features**:

* Mountable on multiple Compute Engine VMs
* Simple to configure and use
* Available in basic and high-performance tiers

**Use Cases**:

* Shared configuration or media files
* Applications that require file-level access across instances
* CMS or shared development environments

---

### 4. **Local SSDs**

**What it is**:
High-speed, physically attached SSDs for temporary storage needs on a VM.

**Key Features**:

* Very fast I/O performance
* Temporary (data lost when the VM is stopped or deleted)
* Lower latency than persistent disks

**Use Cases**:

* High-speed caching
* Temporary scratch space
* Data processing or video transcoding

---

### 5. **Cloud SQL / Spanner / Firestore / Bigtable** (Database Storage)

These services are optimized for structured data but involve backend storage.

**Cloud SQL**:

* Managed relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
* Used for traditional web apps and business apps

**Cloud Spanner**:

* Globally distributed SQL database
* Strong consistency and high availability

**Firestore**:

* NoSQL document database
* Used in mobile and web apps

**Bigtable**:

* NoSQL wide-column store
* Used for analytics, telemetry, and IoT

---

### 6. **Coldline and Archive Classes**

These are *storage classes* within Cloud Storage optimized for low-cost, infrequent access.

**Coldline**:

* For data accessed quarterly
* Ideal for disaster recovery

**Archive**:

* For data accessed once a year or less
* Cheapest class, ideal for legal or compliance backups

**Use Cases**:

* Archiving long-term legal data
* Rarely accessed backups
* Data retention for compliance

| Cloud SQL/Spanner | Structured app data            | Yes        | Yes      | Storing transactional data              |
| Coldline/Archive  | Archival data                  | Yes        | Yes      | Infrequently accessed backups           |
